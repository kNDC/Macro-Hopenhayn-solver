# Solver for the Hopenhayn model in general equilibrium

MATLAB routines solving for the general equilibrium version of the Hopenhayn (1992) model in continuous time.  The algorithm utilises the standard multidimensional version of the Newton-Raphson algorithm enhanced by the technique used in Fischer (1992) and Fischer (1995) for solving constrained optimisation problems with occasionally binding constraints and linear complementarity problems (LCPs) respectively.
